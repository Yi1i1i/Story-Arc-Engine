## STORY ARC ENGINE By Yi1i1i

## What This Script Does:
This script automatically helps guide and enhance your story by generating a "Story Arc" — a high-level plot outline made up of key events. It feeds this outline into the AI's context regularly to keep storytelling coherent, immersive, and progressively structured.

## How It Works:
Before the set turn, the script prepares the AI to generate an updated story arc.
You will see a warning telling you that the next turn will be used for generating a story arc.
After clicking “Continue,” a brief pause message appears while the arc is being created by the AI. It will ask for a retry if the AI fails to create a story arc correctly.
When complete, a confirmation message lets you know the story arc has been saved and will influence future storytelling.

## How It Helps:
Keeps long stories focused and immersive.
Reduces inconsistencies or meandering plotlines.
Encourages richer, more dynamic story progression.
Ensures major events stay tied together logically.

## Customize It:
You can view (Spoilers!) or edit the Story Arc at any time in the Story Cards under “Current Story Arc.”
You are free to modify the settings as well in the settings story card.

## How to Install
Plug and play! Simply plug each script to their respective hooks.
